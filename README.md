Lightning Articles is a website that allows users to post articles, and readers to pay Bitcoin using the lightning network to unlock and read those articles. We used the LN Bits APIs and packages to setup a paywall. The backend is written in Python 3 using the Django framework. The database is SQL Lite. That is where we store our data including articles and user information. Users can sign in an out in order to read articles that they previously paid for. The main screen shows a view of all articles sorted by "revenue", where the most popular articles and raise to the top of the charts.

### Future Features

In the future we would like to add the following features to Lightning Articles:
1. Ability for publishers to cash out the revenue generated by their articles into their own private wallets
2. Rich articles: allow publishers to add pictures and markup to their articles. Currently articles are just text files
3. Open our site to the public, so that actual users can start to publish and read articles from around the web!
